        Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani | How to make Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani? - There are so many kinds of Biryanis across the world, and each one is unique. And they change in taste and form depending on the region where they are made.
    </p>

    <p>
        But then there may be innumerable Biryanis, but “Hyderabadi Dum Biryani” has its own place. Sourness, spice and taste in it are all unique. In fact, Hyderabadi Dum Biryani or Mutton Dum Biryani first and only then Chicken Biryani and Veg Biryanis have found their name.

Though Hyderabadi Biryani has been introduced by the Nizams, Andhras have added their own spices and made it even tastier. Biryani should be cooked on the wood fire, and only then it is authentic say Biryani Masters. But now that we do not use wood fire much, we could still get the same taste cooking on a gas stove.

When I learned how to make Biryani, it was a big challenge for me to make small quantities, just for 4 -5 people. I tried many times, reduced the spices and made it. But still, there was a problem in Dum, or it was too hard, or there was burnt crust at the bottom. But every time, I had the satisfaction that I learned something new. So this recipe is based on a lot of experience. And I have a detailed explanation on what could go wrong and what to do.

    <h3>
        <mark>instruction to cook</mark>
    </h3>
    <h4>
        what kind of rice to use?
    </h4>
    <p>
        I have used Basmati Rice, soaked for an hour, for this recipe. The Rice should always be older than a year. Only then you will get a good grain.
    </p>
    <h4>
        can we use <mark>sona masuri</mark>?
    </h4>
    <p>Sona Masuri can also be washed and soaked for an hour. But it needs a little bit more Dum. And more Water should be added for the Dum.</p>
    <h4>Can we increase the measures to double to make double the quantity?</h4>
    <p>More or less, yes. But whenever I make double, I add only 1.3/4. That is Salt or Mirchi that I add for a cup of Rice is increased to 1.3/4 cup or spoons only while cooking double. How much ever technology we may have, I bet that it cannot precisely determine the taste each human being likes. I have given my regular ingredients. But it is always better for you to taste and decide on your measurements.</p>
    <h4>
        When the Biryani is doubled, should the Dum be for a longer time?
    </h4>
    <p>Half the duration is enough. I have used 1.1/2 Cups Rice for this recipe and 15 minutes of Dum is enough. If you make 3 cups Rice, it is enough to Dum it for 20 minutes.

        Biryani should never be mixed while got. The stove should be switched off and left like that for 20 minutes. Even the vessel should not be kept down on the floor. Otherwise, the heat settles to the bottom and then on to the floor and the Biryani Dum does not cook enough. So you should leave it on the stove.</p>
     <h4>Why is the Chicken rubbery with no Masala sticking to it?</h4>
     <p>Chicken should always be less than a kilo. An older, bigger Chicken does not cook well.

        If the Chicken has to soak in all the flavours, then it has to be marinated in a fridge overnight and then it is tender after Dum.
        
        I have used tissues for this Biryani Dum. You could use Banana Leaves or a leaf plate.
        
        You should have equal parts of Rice and Chicken for Chicken Biryani. Whatever the measure I took, I added double the Chicken.</p>
     <h4>How will we know Rice is 70 % cooked?</h4>
     <p>If you test the grain with your fingers, it should be cooked more than half and should have some brittleness. That is 70% cooking.

        If the Rice is soaked for an hour, then every 1.1/2 cups of Rice cooks 10% every 3-4 minutes.</p>
     <h4>How to prevent Biryani from burning at the bottom?</h4>
     <p>Use only a thick-bottomed Vessel. In case you do not have such vessels, use a thick-bottomed cooker.</p>
     <h4>Does the Chicken gets cooked in 15 minutes?</h4>
     <p>If a tender Chicken is marinated in spices for 2 hours or overnight, it definitely gets cooked. Even after you switch off the stove, it gets cooked more in Dum.</p>
     <h4>Finally, some tips to make the Biryani tastier</h4>
     <p>I have used Fried Onions as I had some. If you fry Onions in Oil and then use that Oil in the Biryani, the Biryani will get a nice aroma.

        Chicken Biryani tastes better with more Ghee.
        
        If you add Lemon Juice to Rice while it is boiling, then the Rice stays white.
        
        The Rice should be added only when the Water is boiling, or Rice becomes sticky, and the grains are not fluffy.
        
        Salt should be more in Biryani. If you taste the Water, it should taste like seawater. It is only the Salt that you add to boiling water that gets into the Biryani. The Salt does not stick even if you add later to the Biryani. So you must check Salt while the Rice is added to the boiling Water.
